## Description
This a very basic polling app that I created as an exercise to learn the basics of Flask.

Features:
- Pulls poll options from database and presents them in a dropdown list.
- Creates a new user for each new session and saves their user id in a cookie.
- Saves user's answer to database once they have submitted it.

Uses flask and addons.

## TODO
Data analysis/graphing on users' answers.

## Future Enhancements
Use something better than cookies to identify whether user has answered question.
